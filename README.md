This project is inspired by bolt.new, lovable.dev, v0.dev and much more! This project features an AI powered project builder console-based. I'm planning to add a GUI soon, if any suggestions arise, please contact imjustbetterxd12@gmail.com.

To get started: start by cloning this repo:
`git clone https://github.com/Sjdjdiejdrirhdkjej/bolt.newer.git`

To install dependencies is easy, as they are not heavyweight like playwright and transformers.
```
cd bolt.newer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

COMING SOON
  1. A web based GUI hosted locally
  2. Wider range of model support (currently you can just add it yourself and add a pull req)
  3. Possibly add a computer use agent powered by E2B/scrapybara

Contact imjustbetterxd12@gmail if you have any suggestions!
